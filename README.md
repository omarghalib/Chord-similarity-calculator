# Chord similarity calculator
This project contains: 

 - A json parser for The McGill Billboard Project
 - A calculator to calculate and record the similarity of songs in terms of chords

This parser is focusing on what chords are present in each song, so it eliminates redunduncy and discards all data about timestamps and order of chords
